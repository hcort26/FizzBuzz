# FizzBuzz Program in Java

## What is this project?

This project is a simple Java program that prints numbers from **1 to 100** while following these rules:

1. If a number is **divisible by 3**, it prints **"Fizz"** instead of the number.
2. If a number is **divisible by 5**, it prints **"Buzz"** instead of the number.
3. If a number is **divisible by both 3 and 5**, it prints **"FizzBuzz"** instead of the number.
4. If a number is **not divisible by 3 or 5**, it prints the number itself.

### How does it work?

The program uses a **for loop** to go through numbers from `1` to `100`. It checks whether the current number is divisible by `3`, `5`, or both, using **if-else statements**. Based on the condition, it prints the correct output.
